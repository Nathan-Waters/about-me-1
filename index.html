      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        What's up guys, mt name is Steve Horne. I am married and have 2 kids. A girl, named Teagan and a boy, named Talon. 
        Teagan is 7 and Talon is 3. In my free time I enjoy smashing weights and family time.
        I joined the Army right out of highschool apart of the 1st Battalion 24th infantry division. After all that and over a year in Afghnaistan
        I worked at a military alternative highschool for 5 years called Oregon Youth Challange. Recently I quit my most recent job in Juevenile
