      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        What's up guys, mt name is Steve Horne. I am married and have 2 kids. A girl, named Teagan and a boy, named Talon. 
        Teagan is 7 and Talon is 8. In my free time I enjoy smashing weights and family time.
        I joined the Army right out of highschool apart of the 1st Battalion 24th infantry division. After all that I worked at Oregon Youth 
        Challange for 5 years and then a local jail in Coeur D alene Idaho. Throughout the last 10 years I have been a personal trainer as well.
        I have a variety of different certificates to include.
        
        <li>Crossfit level 1 Trainer January 2022</li>
        <li>USAW Level 1 trainer issued November 2020</li>
        <li>ISSA Certified personal trainer issued August 2020</li>
        <li>ISSA powerlifting coach August 2020</li>

        These have all been renewed fairly recently as most have to every 2 years. Recently I have made a big life decision to quit my job at the jail
        and start computer programming school @ Code Fellows!
